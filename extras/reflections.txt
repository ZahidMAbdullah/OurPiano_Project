Reflections on Building "Our Piano"

## What I Learned

- **I2C Communication:** Gained practical experience with the I2C protocol for master-slave communication across multiple Arduino boards.
- **Game Design Logic:** Learned how to implement a sequence-based reaction game with increasing difficulty and state management.
- **Arduino LOL Shield:** Understood the LED matrix behavior and challenges with pin limitations.
- **Embedded Audio Playback:** Mapped musical notes to their frequencies and generated tones using Arduino’s `tone()` function.
- **Synchronization:** Learned to coordinate animations, audio, input, and scoring in real-time.
- **Debugging Multi-Device Systems:** Developed patience and skills to troubleshoot timing bugs, electrical issues, and cross-device errors.

## Challenges Faced

- **LOL Shield Pin Occupation:** The shield blocked most of the Arduino pins, so we couldn’t add buttons or other components directly. We solved this using I2C with another Arduino.
- **Timing Issues:** Making sure the button presses were read accurately when the LED was in the scoring zone required careful fine-tuning.
- **Game Difficulty Balance:** It was hard to make the game fun and not too difficult or too easy. We added a speed adjustment system to gradually adapt based on the player’s performance.
- **Synchronization Between Arduinos:** Getting all the devices to work together smoothly over I2C required careful planning and consistent data handling.

This project helped us grow both technically and creatively. It taught us how to bring together hardware, software, and user experience to build something interactive and fun.
