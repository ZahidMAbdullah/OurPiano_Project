Ideas and Reflections - "Our Piano" Project

What We Learned:
----------------
- We gained hands-on experience with I2C communication, which is essential for multi-Arduino setups.
- We learned how to manage multiple devices with different roles (input, display, logic).
- Using the LOL shield helped us understand the limitations and capabilities of LED matrix animation.
- We developed a better understanding of note frequencies and how to simulate musical notes with code.

Challenges Faced:
-----------------
- The LOL shield occupies all GPIO pins, so we had to use multiple Arduinos to separate responsibilities.
- Getting I2C communication to work reliably required careful synchronization and debugging.
- LED animation timing and speed adjustments were tricky to balance for enjoyable gameplay.
- Initially, wrong button presses and missed notes were both causing the game to end, making it frustrating. We had to tweak the rules to allow missed notes but not incorrect ones.
- Displaying real-time scores and syncing it with the game logic required precision in message-passing between Arduinos.

Future Improvements:
--------------------
- Add support for multiple tunes and difficulty levels.
- Display ‚ÄúGame Over‚Äù and ‚ÄúHigh Score‚Äù messages visually using the LOL shield.
- Combine all logic into a single microcontroller with multiplexers or port expanders to simplify hardware.

Overall, it was a fun and educational project that combined game design, electronics, and real-time communication.
