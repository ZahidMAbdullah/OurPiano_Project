I2C Communication Notes - "Our Piano" Project

Overview:
---------
The project involves communication between three Arduino Uno boards using the I2C protocol.

I2C Roles:
----------
- Master Arduino:
  - Handles button input from 8 physical buttons.
  - Sends note values (integers 0 to 7) based on button presses to the slave Arduinos.
  - Controls the game logic related to user input.

- Slave Arduino 1 (LOL Shield):
  - Receives note values from the master.
  - Controls the LED animation corresponding to the current note.
  - Matches user input with the falling LEDs.

- Slave Arduino 2 (7-Segment Display):
  - Displays the current score.
  - Also receives commands from the master via I2C.

I2C Addresses:
--------------
Each slave device has a unique I2C address. For example:
- LOL Shield Arduino: `0x08`
- 7-Segment Display Arduino: `0x09`

The master uses these addresses to send data to the appropriate slave:
```cpp
Wire.beginTransmission(0x08); // Talk to LOL
Wire.write(note_value);
Wire.endTransmission();
